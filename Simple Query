Compose an SQL query that computes the average appointment duration for each patient based on their last five appointments. The Appointments table includes a "Duration" column that represents the appointment duration in minutes.

SELECT
    PatientID,
    AppointmentDate,
    Duration,
    AVG(Duration) OVER (
        PARTITION BY PatientID 
        ORDER BY AppointmentDate 
        ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS RollingAvgDuration
FROM 
    Appointments
ORDER BY 
    PatientID, AppointmentDate;
